An algorithm for determinig leap years.
    if a year is (evenly) divisible by 4, then it is a leap year. However there
    are a couple of exceptions. If the year is divisible by 4 but is also 
    divisible by 100, then it is not a leap yearâ€” unless, it is also divisible 
    by 400, then it is. For example, 1996 and 2000 were leap years, but 1900 was not. 

    if (year % 4 == 0) and (not (year % 100 == 0) or (year % 400 == 0))
        leap_year = True
    else:
        leap_year = False
